Welcome to my webpage, I am a research engineer at [Dassault Syst√®mes](https://www.3ds.com/), working on topics related to mathematical modeling for computational anatomy, in the context of the [MediTwin project](https://www.3ds.com/newsroom/press-releases/meditwin-launch).

Prior to that I worked as a research software engineer in the [HeKa](https://team.inria.fr/heka/fr/) team. My activities there revolved around the development of [scikit-shapes]() an open-source scientific toolkit in python for shape analysis, in collaboration with [Jean Feydy](https://www.jeanfeydy.com/).

Even before, I was a PhD student in the [DataShape](https://www.inria.fr/fr/datashape) team, under the supervision of [Marc Glisse](https://geometrica.saclay.inria.fr/team/Marc.Glisse/) and [Pascal Massart](http://massart.pascal.free.fr/Site/Home.html). My subject was the development of a new clustering algorithm for flow and mass cytometry data that takes into account an eventual independence structure among the variables. This work has been done in collaboration with the company [Metafora](https://www.metafora-biosystems.com/).
