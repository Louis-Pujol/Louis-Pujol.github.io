Welcome to my webpage, I am Louis Pujol and I work as a research software engineer in the [HeKa](https://team.inria.fr/heka/fr/) team. My current activities revolve around the development of a scientific toolkit in python for shape analysis, in collaboration with [Jean Feydy](https://www.jeanfeydy.com/).

Prior to that, I was a PhD student in the [DataShape](https://www.inria.fr/fr/datashape) team, under the supervision of [Marc Glisse](https://geometrica.saclay.inria.fr/team/Marc.Glisse/) and [Pascal Massart](http://massart.pascal.free.fr/Site/Home.html). My subject was the development of a new clustering algorithm for flow and mass cytometry data that takes into account an eventual independence structure among the variables. This work have been done in collaboration with the company [Metafora](https://www.metafora-biosystems.com/).
